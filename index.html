<h2 id="introduction">Who I am</h2>
<p>My name is David, I am 30 years old, currently living in Berlin.
    I will be on a 3 month sabbatical to find a way to get my writing online
    after finally finishing my formal education mid-September 2024
    with the goal of working as a lawyer. I am interested in philosophy, sociology and faith, especially
    how it manifests in ways that are not classically deemed religious.</p>
<p>I have a background in a varied movement practice, ranging from olympic weight lifting,
modern dance and Tai Chi, mainly inspired by folks like @portal.ido and Moshé Feldenkrais, although all of it has been very much on hold since entering
the final exams phase. I can't wait to pick up were I've left off.</p>
<h2 id="the-basics">What I aim at</h2>
<p>First, to re-engage with the above. What I liked most about life was the
unhinged binge-sessions into random topics, gaining insight and integrating it into
the present. Because of the exams, I was not able to do so for a long time and I 
    really feel the toll. </p>
<p> Second, to share the insights of cleaning up the mess of a formal education (see below). </p>
<p> Third, find a scene to start building stuff together.</p>
    <p>I have already created some kind of framework to engage with, which looks like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>On X I want to post daily. With the inspiration of @DefenderofBasic, I want to use X like a 
Slack, but at the same time, I see that @CulturalTutor - Format seems to work really well. So 
I see something like 100-200 post Atomic Essay or deep dives into the history of things</li>
    <li>On Medium I want to post weekly. I have found, Medium loves the personal essay mixed
with practical insights. 1000-2000 words are the preferred range.</li>
    <li>On Substack I want to post monthly. Here I can summarize what I have accomplished
in the month, paired with insights and book, podcasts or video series recommendations</li>
    </ul>
<p>The aim here is to experiment with different formats and find out what works for me.
The overarching aim is to find my way as a freelance writer, able to sustain myself from 
my writing. I am not sure, how exactly this will work. I have come to the realization,
that the doing is the motive, not the end goal. I realize that I can only say this, 
because I have a formal education, but one has to amor your fati, right?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lists">In the Meantime</h2>
<p>My current calendar looks like this</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>September 2-13: Final 2nd State Examination</li>
<li>September 15-October 1st: Abruzzo and Puglia, Italy</li>
<li>October 2-23: Hanover, Germany</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
